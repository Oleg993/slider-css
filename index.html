            <p>
              New York, often called New York City (NYC), is the largest city by
              population in the United States. It is at the southern end of the
              state of New York. New York's population is similar to Chicago in
              Illinois with over 8 million people currently living in it, and
              over 22 million people live in the bigger New York metropolitan
              area. It is the financial capital of the U.S. since it is home to
              the nation's stock market, Wall Street, and the One World Trade
              Center.

            <h2>Have you ever been to London?</h2>
            <p>
              London is the capital and largest city of England and the United
              Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million.[1] It stands
              on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile
              (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major
              settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient
              core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium
              and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 1][10] The City of
              Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries
              hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th
              century,[11] the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis
              around this core, historically split between the counties of
              Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since
              1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed
              by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.

            <p>
              Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked
              country located at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern
              Europe.[f][16] It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the
              west, Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the
              east.

              Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three
              territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean
              and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering over 9.98 million
              square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the
              world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and
              western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres
              (5,525 mi), is the world's longest binational land border.
              Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan
              areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
